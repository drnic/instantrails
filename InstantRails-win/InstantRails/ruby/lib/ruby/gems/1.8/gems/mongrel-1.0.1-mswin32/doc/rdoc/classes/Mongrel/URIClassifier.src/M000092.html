 * call-seq:
 *    uc.resolve(&quot;/someuri&quot;) -&gt; &quot;/someuri&quot;, &quot;&quot;, handler
 *    uc.resolve(&quot;/someuri/pathinfo&quot;) -&gt; &quot;/someuri&quot;, &quot;/pathinfo&quot;, handler
 *    uc.resolve(&quot;/notfound/orhere&quot;) -&gt; nil, nil, nil
 *    uc.resolve(&quot;/&quot;) -&gt; &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, handler  # if uc.register(&quot;/&quot;, handler)
 *    uc.resolve(&quot;/path/from/root&quot;) -&gt; &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/path/from/root&quot;, handler  # if uc.register(&quot;/&quot;, handler) 
 * 
 * Attempts to resolve either the whole URI or at the longest prefix, returning
 * the prefix (as script_info), path (as path_info), and registered handler
 * (usually an HttpHandler).  If it doesn't find a handler registered at the longest
 * match then it returns nil,nil,nil.
 *
 * Because the resolver uses a trie you are able to register a handler at *any* character
 * in the URI and it will be handled as long as it's the longest prefix.  So, if you 
 * registered handler #1 at &quot;/something/lik&quot;, and #2 at &quot;/something/like/that&quot;, then a
 * a search for &quot;/something/like&quot; would give you #1.  A search for &quot;/something/like/that/too&quot;
 * would give you #2.
 * 
 * This is very powerful since it means you can also attach handlers to parts of the ; 
 * (semi-colon) separated path params, any part of the path, use off chars, anything really.
 * It also means that it's very efficient to do this only taking as long as the URI has
 * characters.
 *
 * A slight modification to the CGI 1.2 standard is given for handlers registered to &quot;/&quot;.
 * CGI expects all CGI scripts to be at some script path, so it doesn't really say anything
 * about a script that handles the root.  To make this work, the resolver will detect that
 * the requested handler is at &quot;/&quot;, and return that for script_name, and then simply return
 * the full URI back as path_info.
 *
 * It expects strings with no embedded '\0' characters.  Don't try other string-like stuff yet.
