Long:    'N' or 'L'
Integer: 'I'
Pointer: 'P'
Void:    'V'

BOOL  		=> 'I'
DWORD 		=> 'L'
HANDLE		=> 'L'
LPDWORD		=> 'P' (or 'L')
LPTSTR 		=> 'P'
UINT  		=> 'I'
VOID        => 'V'
WORD        => 'I'
LPVOID      => 'L' (or 'P')

= C Data Types
void     	=> 'V'
void*    	=> 'P'
char*    	=> 'P'
const char* => 'L'
int			=> 'I'
long        => 'L'
struct      => 'P'
struct*     => 'P'

In practice most LPVOID types should be designated as 'L' because this
usually means the function is looking for an address.
