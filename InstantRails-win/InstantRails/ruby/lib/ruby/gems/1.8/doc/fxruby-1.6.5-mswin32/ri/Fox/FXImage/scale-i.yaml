- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Rescale pixels image to the specified width and height. Note that this serves a slightly different purpose than the base class resize() method, which simply resizes the client-side pixel data buffer but doesn't transform the image.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The optional third argument specifies the <em>quality</em> of the scaling algorithm used. By default, #scale uses a fast (but low quality) nearest-neighbor algorithm for scaling the image to its new size. To use the higher-quality scaling algorithm from FOX 1.0, you should pass in a value of 1 as the third argument to #scale."
