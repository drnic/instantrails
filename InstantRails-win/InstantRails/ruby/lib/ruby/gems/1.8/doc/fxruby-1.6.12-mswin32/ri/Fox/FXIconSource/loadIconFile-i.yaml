  body: Load an icon from the file <em>filename</em>. By default, the file extension is stripped and used as the icon <em>type</em>; if an explicit icon type is forced, then that type is used and the extension is ignored. For example, loadIcon(&quot;icon&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;) will try to load a CompuServe GIF file, since the filename does not give any clue as to the type of the icon. Returns a reference to the icon.
