  body: "  * Single aggregate value: The single value is type cast to Fixnum for COUNT, Float for AVG, and the given column's type for everything else.\n  * Grouped values: This returns an ordered hash of the values and groups them by the :group option.  It takes either a column name, or the name\n    of a belongs_to association.\n\n      values = Person.maximum(:age, :group =&gt; 'last_name')\n      puts values[&quot;Drake&quot;]\n      =&gt; 43\n\n      drake  = Family.find_by_last_name('Drake')\n      values = Person.maximum(:age, :group =&gt; :family) # Person belongs_to :family\n      puts values[drake]\n      =&gt; 43\n\n      values.each do |family, max_age|\n      ...\n      end\n"

    body: "<tt>:joins</tt>: An SQL fragment for additional joins like &quot;LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id&quot;. (Rarely needed). The records will be returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond to the table's columns."

    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:group</tt>: An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the GROUP BY SQL-clause."
