  body: "An Image is a rectangular array of pixels. It supports two representations of these pixels: a client-side pixel buffer which is stored as an array of FXColor, and a server-side pixmap which is stored in an organization directly compatible with the screen, for fast drawing onto the device. The server-side representation is not directly accessible from the current process as it lives in the process of the X Server or GDI."

    label: "+IMAGE_KEEP+:"
    body: Keep pixel data in client. By default, FOX discards of the client-side pixel data for an image after you call create() for that image. When the <tt>IMAGE_KEEP</tt> option is set for FXImage (or one of its subclasses), the client-side buffer is maintained. You will typically want to set this option if you intend to do repeated re-rendering of the image after it has been created.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_OWNED+:"
    body: If the <tt>IMAGE_OWNED</tt> option is set, the FXImage object assumes ownership of its client-side pixel data (if any).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_DITHER+:"
    body: Dither image to look better
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_NEAREST+:"
    body: Turn off dithering and map to nearest color
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_OPAQUE+:"
    body: Force opaque background
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_ALPHACOLOR+:"
    body: By default, FOX will use the transparency color obtained from the image file as the transparency (alpha) color. If you pass the <tt>IMAGE_ALPHACOLOR</tt> flag, the user-specified transparency color will be used instead.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_SHMI+:"
    body: Using shared memory image
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "+IMAGE_SHMP+:"
    body: Using shared memory pixmap
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI
