- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method provides easy access to ANSI color sequences, without the user needing to remember to CLEAR at the end of each sequence. Just pass the <em>string</em> to color, followed by a list of <em>colors</em> you would like it to be affected by. The <em>colors</em> can be HighLine class constants, or symbols (:blue for BLUE, for example). A CLEAR will automatically be embedded to the end of the returned String.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method returns the original <em>string</em> unchanged if HighLine::use_color? is <tt>false</tt>.
