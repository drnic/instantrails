  body: "A bitmap is a rectangular array of pixels. It supports two representations of these pixels: a client-side pixel buffer, and a server-side pixmap which is stored in an organization directly compatible with the screen, for fast drawing onto the device. The server-side representation is not directly accessible from the current process at it lives in the process of the X server or GDI (on Microsoft Windows). The client-side pixel array is of size height x (width+7)/8 bytes; in other words, 8 pixels packed into a single byte, starting with bit zero on the left."
