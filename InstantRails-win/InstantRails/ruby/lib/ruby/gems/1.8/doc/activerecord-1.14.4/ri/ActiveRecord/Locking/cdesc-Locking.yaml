- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Active Records support optimistic locking if the field <tt>lock_version</tt> is present. Each update to the record increments the lock_version column and the locking facilities ensure that records instantiated twice will let the last one saved raise a StaleObjectError if the first was also updated. Example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  p1 = Person.find(1)\n  p2 = Person.find(1)\n\n  p1.first_name = &quot;Michael&quot;\n  p1.save\n\n  p2.first_name = &quot;should fail&quot;\n  p2.save # Raises a ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You're then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the exception and either rolling back, merging, or otherwise apply the business logic needed to resolve the conflict.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You must ensure that your database schema defaults the lock_version column to 0.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This behavior can be turned off by setting <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.lock_optimistically = false</tt>. To override the name of the lock_version column, invoke the <tt>set_locking_column</tt> method. This method uses the same syntax as <tt>set_table_name</tt>
