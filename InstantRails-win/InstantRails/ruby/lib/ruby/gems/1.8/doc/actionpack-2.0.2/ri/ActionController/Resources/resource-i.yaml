  body: "Creates named routes for implementing verb-oriented controllers for a singleton resource. A singleton resource is global to its current context. For unnested singleton resources, the resource is global to the current user visiting the application, such as a user's /account profile. For nested singleton resources, the resource is global to its parent resource, such as a <tt>projects</tt> resource that <tt>has_one :project_manager</tt>. The <tt>project_manager</tt> should be mapped as a singleton resource under <tt>projects</tt>:"
