  body: "Construct a device context for drawing into a window (specified by <em>drawable</em>). If <em>event</em> is +nil_, the device context is constructed for normal drawing, and the clip rectangle is set to the whole rectange. If <em>event</em> is a reference to an FXEvent, the device context is constructed for painting in response to an expose; this sets the clip rectangle to the exposed rectangle. If an optional code block is provided, the new device context will be passed into the block as an argument and #end will be called automatically when the block terminates."
