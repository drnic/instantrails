  body: With no arguments, asserts that one or more elements are updated or inserted by RJS statements.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Use the <tt>id</tt> argument to narrow down the assertion to only statements that update or insert an element with that identifier.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P

  text: Using blocks
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Without a block, #assert_select_rjs merely asserts that the response contains one or more RJS statements that replace or update content."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "With a block, #assert_select_rjs also selects all elements used in these statements and passes them to the block. Nested assertions are supported."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Calling #assert_select_rjs with no arguments and using nested asserts asserts that the HTML content is returned by one or more RJS statements. Using #assert_select directly makes the same assertion on the content, but without distinguishing whether the content is returned in an HTML or JavaScript."
