- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Opens a handle to the new EventLog <tt>source</tt> on <tt>server</tt>, or the local machine if no host is specified. Typically, your source will be 'Application, 'Security' or 'System', although you can specify a custom log file as well.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If a custom, registered log file name cannot be found, the event logging service opens the 'Application' log file. This is the behavior of the underlying Windows function, not my own doing.
