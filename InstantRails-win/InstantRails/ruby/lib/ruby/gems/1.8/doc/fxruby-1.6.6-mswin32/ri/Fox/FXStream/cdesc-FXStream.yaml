  body: A stream is a way to serialize data and objects into a byte stream. Each item of data that is saved or loaded from the stream may be byte-swapped, thus allowing little-endian machines to read data produced on big endian ones and vice-versa. Data is serialized exactly as-is. There are no tags or other markers inserted into the stream; thus, the stream may be used to save or load arbitrary binary data. Objects derived from FXObjects may be serialized also; whenever a reference to an object is serialized, a table is consulted to determine if the same object has been encountered previously; if not, the object is added to the table and then its contents are serialized. If the object has been encountered before, only a reference to the object is serialized. When loading back a serialized object, new instances are constructed using the default constructor, and subsequently the object's contents are loaded. A special container object may be passed in which is placed in the table as if it had been encountered before; this will cause only references to this object to be saved. The container object is typically the top-level document object which manages all objects contained by it. Additional objects may be added using addObject(); these will not be actually saved or loaded.
