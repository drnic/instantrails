    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>scope</tt> - restricts what is to be considered a list. Given a symbol, it'll attach &quot;_id&quot; (if that hasn't been already) and use that as the foreign key restriction. It's also possible to give it an entire string that is interpolated if you need a tighter scope than just a foreign key. Example: <tt>acts_as_list :scope =&gt; 'todo_list_id = #{todo_list_id} AND completed = 0'</tt>"
