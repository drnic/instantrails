- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method enables you to use the flash as a central messaging system in your app. When you need to pass an object to the next action, you use the standard flash assign (<tt>[]=</tt>). When you need to pass an object to the current action, you use <tt>now</tt>, and your object will vanish when the current action is done.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Entries set via <tt>now</tt> are accessed the same way as standard entries: <tt>flash['my-key']</tt>."
