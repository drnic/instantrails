  body: Close the window, return <tt>true</tt> if actually closed. If <em>notify</em> is <tt>true</tt>, the target will receive a <tt>SEL_CLOSE</tt> message to determine if it is OK to close the window. If the target ignores the <tt>SEL_CLOSE</tt> message or returns 0, the window will be closed, and subsequently deleted. When the last main window has been closed, the application will receive an <tt>ID_QUIT</tt> message and will be closed.
