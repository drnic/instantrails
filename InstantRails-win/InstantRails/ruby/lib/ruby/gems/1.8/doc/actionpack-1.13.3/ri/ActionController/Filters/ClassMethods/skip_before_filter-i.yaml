- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Removes the specified filters from the <tt>before</tt> filter chain. Note that this only works for skipping method-reference filters, not procs. This is especially useful for managing the chain in inheritance hierarchies where only one out of many sub-controllers need a different hierarchy.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You can control the actions to skip the filter for with the <tt>:only</tt> and <tt>:except</tt> options, just like when you apply the filters.
