  body: "    aButton.connect(SEL_COMMAND) { |sender, selector, data|\n      ... code to handle this event ...\n    }\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The arguments passed into the block are the <em>sender</em> of the message (i.e. the widget), the <em>selector</em> for the message, and any message-specific <em>data</em>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "When #connect is called with two arguments, the second argument should be some callable object such as a Method or Proc instance, e.g."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    aButton.connect(SEL_COMMAND, method(:onCommand))\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "As with the one-argument form of #connect, the callable object will be &quot;called&quot; with three arguments (the sender, selector and message data)."
