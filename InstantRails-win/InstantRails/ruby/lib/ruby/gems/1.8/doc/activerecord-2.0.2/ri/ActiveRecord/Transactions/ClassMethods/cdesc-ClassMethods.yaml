- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Transactions are protective blocks where SQL statements are only permanent if they can all succeed as one atomic action. The classic example is a transfer between two accounts where you can only have a deposit if the withdrawal succeeded and vice versa. Transactions enforce the integrity of the database and guard the data against program errors or database break-downs. So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you have a number of statements that must be executed together or not at all. Example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  transaction do\n    david.withdrawal(100)\n    mary.deposit(100)\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This example will only take money from David and give to Mary if neither <tt>withdrawal</tt> nor <tt>deposit</tt> raises an exception. Exceptions will force a ROLLBACK that returns the database to the state before the transaction was begun. Be aware, though, that the objects by default will <em>not</em> have their instance data returned to their pre-transactional state.

  text: Different ActiveRecord classes in a single transaction
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Though the transaction class method is called on some ActiveRecord class, the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of that class. In this example a <tt>Balance</tt> record is transactionally saved even though <tt>transaction</tt> is called on the <tt>Account</tt> class:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Account.transaction do\n    balance.save!\n    account.save!\n  end\n"

  text: Transactions are not distributed across database connections
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "A transaction acts on a single database connection. If you have multiple class-specific databases, the transaction will not protect interaction among them. One workaround is to begin a transaction on each class whose models you alter:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Student.transaction do\n    Course.transaction do\n      course.enroll(student)\n      student.units += course.units\n    end\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is a poor solution, but full distributed transactions are beyond the scope of Active Record.

  text: Save and destroy are automatically wrapped in a transaction
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Both Base#save and Base#destroy come wrapped in a transaction that ensures that whatever you do in validations or callbacks will happen under the protected cover of a transaction. So you can use validations to check for values that the transaction depends on or you can raise exceptions in the callbacks to rollback.

  level: 2
  text: Exception handling
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Also have in mind that exceptions thrown within a transaction block will be propagated (after triggering the ROLLBACK), so you should be ready to catch those in your application code. One exception is the ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, which will trigger a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised by the transaction block.
