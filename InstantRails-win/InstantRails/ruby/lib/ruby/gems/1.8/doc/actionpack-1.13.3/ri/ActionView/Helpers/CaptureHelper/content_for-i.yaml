- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Calling content_for stores the block of markup for later use. Subsequently, you can make calls to it by name with <tt>yield</tt> in another template or in the layout.

  body: "Example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  &lt;% content_for(&quot;header&quot;) do %&gt;\n    alert('hello world')\n  &lt;% end %&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You can use yield :header anywhere in your templates.

  body: "  &lt;%= yield :header %&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "NOTE: Beware that content_for is ignored in caches. So you shouldn't use it for elements that are going to be fragment cached."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The deprecated way of accessing a content_for block was to use a instance variable named @@content_for_#{name_of_the_content_block}@. So <tt>&lt;%= content_for('footer') %&gt;</tt> would be avaiable as <tt>&lt;%= @content_for_footer %&gt;</tt>. The preferred notation now is <tt>&lt;%= yield :footer %&gt;</tt>.
