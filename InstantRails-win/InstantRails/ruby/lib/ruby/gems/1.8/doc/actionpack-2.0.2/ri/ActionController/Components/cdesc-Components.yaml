  body: Components allow you to call other actions for their rendered response while executing another action. You can either delegate the entire response rendering or you can mix a partial response in with your other content.

  body: "  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base\n    # Performs a method and then lets hello_world output its render\n    def delegate_action\n      do_other_stuff_before_hello_world\n      render_component :controller =&gt; &quot;greeter&quot;,  :action =&gt; &quot;hello_world&quot;, :params =&gt; { :person =&gt; &quot;david&quot; }\n    end\n  end\n\n  class GreeterController &lt; ActionController::Base\n    def hello_world\n      render :text =&gt; &quot;#{params[:person]} says, Hello World!&quot;\n    end\n  end\n"

  text: When to use components
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Components should be used with care. They're significantly slower than simply splitting reusable parts into partials and conceptually more complicated. Don't use components as a way of separating concerns inside a single application. Instead, reserve components to those rare cases where you truly have reusable view and controller elements that can be employed across many applications at once.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "So to repeat: Components are a special-purpose approach that can often be replaced with better use of partials and filters."
