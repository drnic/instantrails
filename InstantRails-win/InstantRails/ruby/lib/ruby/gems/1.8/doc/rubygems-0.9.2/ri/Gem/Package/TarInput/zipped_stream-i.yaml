  body: Return an IO stream for the zipped entry.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If zlib is earlier than 1.2.1, then read the entry into memory and create a string IO object from it. This avoids a &quot;buffer error&quot; problem on windows when using an earlier version of zlib. This problem has not been observed in versions of zlib 1.2.1 or later. (Update: Kornelius Kalnbach has reported seeing it in zlib 1.2.1, so the condition now provides the workaround for 1.2.1 as well)"
