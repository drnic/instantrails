- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Takes a Hash and a String of data, parses the String of data filling in the Hash returning an Integer to indicate how much of the data has been read. No matter what the return value, you should call HttpParser#finished? and HttpParser#error? to figure out if it's done parsing or there was an error.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This function now throws an exception when there is a parsing error. This makes the logic for working with the parser much easier. You can still test for an error, but now you need to wrap the parser with an exception handling block.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The third argument allows for parsing a partial request and then continuing the parsing from that position. It needs all of the original data as well so you have to append to the data buffer as you read.
