  body: A splitter window is used to interactively repartition two or more subpanels. Space may be subdivided horizontally (<tt>SPLITTER_HORIZONTAL</tt>, which the default) or vertically (<tt>SPLITTER_VERTICAL</tt> option). When the splitter is itself resized, the right-most (or bottom-most) child window will be resized unless the splitter window is <em>reversed</em>; if the splitter is reversed, the left-most (or top-most) child window will be resized instead. Normally, children are resizable from size 0 upwards; however, if the child in a horizontally-oriented splitter has <tt>LAYOUT_FILL_X</tt> in combination with <tt>LAYOUT_FIX_WIDTH</tt>, it will not be made smaller than its default width, except when the child is the last visible widget (or first when the <tt>SPLITTER_REVERSED</tt> option has been passed to the splitter). In a vertically-oriented splitter, children with <tt>LAYOUT_FILL_Y</tt> and <tt>LAYOUT_FIX_HEIGHT</tt> behave analogously.
