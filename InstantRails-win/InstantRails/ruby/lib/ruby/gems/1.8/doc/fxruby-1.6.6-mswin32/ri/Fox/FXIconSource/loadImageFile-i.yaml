  body: Load an image from the file filename. By default, the file extension is stripped and used as the image type; if an explicit image type is forced, then that type is used and the extension is ignored. For example, loadImage(&quot;image&quot;,&quot;gif&quot;) will try to load a CompuServe GIF file, since the filename does not give any clue as to the type of the image.
