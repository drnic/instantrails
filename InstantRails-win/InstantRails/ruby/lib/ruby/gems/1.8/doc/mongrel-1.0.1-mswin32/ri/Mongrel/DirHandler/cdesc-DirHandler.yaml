- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Serves the contents of a directory. You give it the path to the root where the files are located, and it tries to find the files based on the PATH_INFO inside the directory. If the requested path is a directory then it returns a simple directory listing.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It does a simple protection against going outside it's root path by converting all paths to an absolute expanded path, and then making sure that the final expanded path includes the root path. If it doesn't than it simply gives a 404.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The default content type is &quot;text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; but you can change it anything you want using the DirHandler.default_content_type attribute.
