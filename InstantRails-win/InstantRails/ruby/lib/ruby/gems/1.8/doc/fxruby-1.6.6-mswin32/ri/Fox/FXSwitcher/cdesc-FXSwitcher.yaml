  body: The FXSwitcher layout manager automatically arranges its child windows such that one of them is placed on top; all other child windows are hidden. Switcher provides a convenient method to conserve screen real-estate by arranging several GUI panels to appear in the same space, depending on context. Switcher ignores all layout hints from its children; all children are stretched according to the switcher layout managers own size. When the <tt>SWITCHER_HCOLLAPSE</tt> or <tt>SWITCHER_VCOLLAPSE</tt> options are used, the switcher's default size is based on the width or height of the current child, instead of the maximum width or height of all of the children.
