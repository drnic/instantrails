  body: ActionController::Resources are a way of defining RESTful resources. A RESTful resource, in basic terms, is something that can be pointed at and it will respond with a representation of the data requested. In real terms this could mean a user with a browser requests an HTML page, or that a desktop application requests XML data.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: RESTful design is based on the assumption that there are four generic verbs that a user of an application can request from a resource (the noun).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Resources can be requested using four basic HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the method used denotes the type of action that should take place.

  body: By using the REST convention, users of our application can assume certain things about how the data is requested and how it is returned. Rails simplifies the routing part of RESTful design by supplying you with methods to create them in your routes.rb file.
