  body: If this macro is used, only those attributes named in it will be accessible for mass-assignment, such as <tt>new(attributes)</tt> and <tt>attributes=(attributes)</tt>. This is the more conservative choice for mass-assignment protection. If you'd rather start from an all-open default and restrict attributes as needed, have a look at attr_protected.
