  body: "Set this item's state to opened. The primary result of this change is that the item's icon will change to its &quot;open&quot; icon. This is different from the #expandTree method, which actually collapses part of the tree list, making some items invisible. If <em>notify</em> is <tt>true</tt>, a <tt>SEL_OPENED</tt> message is sent to the list's message target after the item is opened."
