  body: Save pixel data to a stream.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Note that the base class version of #savePixels saves the pixel data as-is, without any image format specific information. For example, if you have a 1024x768 image without an alpha channel (and thus only the red, green and blue channels) the total number of bytes written to the stream will be 1024*768*3*8. The behavior of #savePixels is different for subclasses such as FXPNGImage, where #savePixels will instead save the image data in a specific image file format (i.e. the PNG file format)."
