  body: "A singleton instance of this class is yielded by Inflector.inflections, which can then be used to specify additional inflection rules. Examples:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Inflector.inflections do |inflect|\n    inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\\1\\2en'\n    inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\\1'\n\n    inflect.irregular 'octopus', 'octopi'\n\n    inflect.uncountable &quot;equipment&quot;\n  end\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: New rules are added at the top. So in the example above, the irregular rule for octopus will now be the first of the pluralization and singularization rules that is runs. This guarantees that your rules run before any of the rules that may already have been loaded.
