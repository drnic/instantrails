- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "This can be used to provide a default set of options in the standard way: before rendering the create form, a new model instance is assigned the default options and bound to @model_name. Usually this model is not saved to the database. Instead, a second model object is created when the create request is received. This allows the user to submit a form page more than once with the expected results of creating multiple records. In addition, this allows a single partial to be used to generate form inputs for both edit and create forms."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: By default, post.person_id is the selected option. Specify :selected =&gt; value to use a different selection or :selected =&gt; nil to leave all options unselected.
