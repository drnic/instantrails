  body: Allows you to set all the attributes at once by passing in a hash with keys matching the attribute names (which again matches the column names). Sensitive attributes can be protected from this form of mass-assignment by using the <tt>attr_protected</tt> macro. Or you can alternatively specify which attributes <b>can</b> be accessed in with the <tt>attr_accessible</tt> macro. Then all the attributes not included in that won't be allowed to be mass-assigned.
