  body: A window device context allows drawing into an FXDrawable, such as an on-screen window (i.e. FXWindow and its derivatives) or an off-screen image (FXImage and its derivatives). Because certain hardware resources are locked down, only one FXDCWindow may be locked on a drawable at any one time.
