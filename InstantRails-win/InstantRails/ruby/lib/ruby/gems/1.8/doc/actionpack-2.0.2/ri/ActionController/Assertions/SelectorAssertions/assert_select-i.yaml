  body: An assertion that selects elements and makes one or more equality tests.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the first argument is an element, selects all matching elements starting from (and including) that element and all its children in depth-first order.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If no element if specified, calling #assert_select will select from the response HTML. Calling #assert_select inside an #assert_select block will run the assertion for each element selected by the enclosing assertion."

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The equality test may be one of the following:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>true</tt> -- Assertion is true if at least one element selected.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>false</tt> -- Assertion is true if no element selected.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>String/Regexp</tt> -- Assertion is true if the text value of at least one element matches the string or regular expression.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Integer</tt> -- Assertion is true if exactly that number of elements are selected.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>Range</tt> -- Assertion is true if the number of selected elements fit the range.
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If no equality test specified, the assertion is true if at least one element selected.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "To perform more than one equality tests, use a hash with the following keys:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:text</tt> -- Narrow the selection to elements that have this text value (string or regexp).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:html</tt> -- Narrow the selection to elements that have this HTML content (string or regexp).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:count</tt> -- Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is equal to this value.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:minimum</tt> -- Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is at least this value.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: <tt>:maximum</tt> -- Assertion is true if the number of selected elements is at most this value.
  type: :BULLET
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the method is called with a block, once all equality tests are evaluated the block is called with an array of all matched elements.
