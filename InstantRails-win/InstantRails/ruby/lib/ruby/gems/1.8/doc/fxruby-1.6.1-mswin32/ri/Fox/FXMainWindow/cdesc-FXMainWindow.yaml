  body: The Main Window is usually the central window of an application. Applications may have any number of main windows. When a MainWindow is closed, it sends a SEL_CLOSE message to its target; the target should return 0 if there is no objection against proceeding with the close, and return 1 otherwise. After the SEL_CLOSE message has been sent and no objection was raised, the main window will delete itself.
