- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Because of how Rails is designed you can only have one installed per Ruby interpreter (talk to them about thread safety). Because of this the first time you call this function it does all the config needed to get your Rails working. After that it returns the one handler you've configured. This lets you attach Rails to any URI(s) you want, but it still protects you from threads destroying your handler.
