- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Destroy an object (or multiple objects) that has the given id, the object is instantiated first, therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted. This method is less efficient than ActiveRecord#delete but allows cleanup methods and other actions to be run.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This essentially finds the object (or multiple objects) with the given id, creates a new object from the attributes, and then calls destroy on it.
