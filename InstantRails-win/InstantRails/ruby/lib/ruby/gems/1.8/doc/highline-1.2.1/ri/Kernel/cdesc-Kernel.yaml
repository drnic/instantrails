  body: <tt>require &quot;highline/import&quot;</tt> adds shorcut methods to Kernel, making agree(), ask(), choose() and say() globally available. This is handy for quick and dirty input and output. These methods use the HighLine object in the global variable <tt>$terminal</tt>, which is initialized to used <tt>$stdin</tt> and <tt>$stdout</tt> (you are free to change this). Otherwise, these methods areidentical to their HighLine counterparts, see that class for detailed explinations.
