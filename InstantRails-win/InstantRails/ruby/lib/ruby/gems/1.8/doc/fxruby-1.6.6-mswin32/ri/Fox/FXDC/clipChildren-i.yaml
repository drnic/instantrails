  body: "When you call #clipChildren with the argument <tt>true</tt>, anything that you draw into this window will be clipped by its child windows. In other words, the child windows &quot;obscure&quot; the parent window. This is the default behavior. If you call #clipChildren with <tt>false</tt>, anything that you draw into this window will be visible in its child windows (i.e. the drawing will <b>not</b> be clipped)."
