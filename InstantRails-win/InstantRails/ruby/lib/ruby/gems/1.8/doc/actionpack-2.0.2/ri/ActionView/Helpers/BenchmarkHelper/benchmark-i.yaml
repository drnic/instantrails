- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Allows you to measure the execution time of a block in a template and records the result to the log. Wrap this block around expensive operations or possible bottlenecks to get a time reading for the operation. For example, let's say you thought your file processing method was taking too long; you could wrap it in a benchmark block.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: " &lt;% benchmark &quot;Process data files&quot; do %&gt;\n   &lt;%= expensive_files_operation %&gt;\n &lt;% end %&gt;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: That would add something like &quot;Process data files (0.34523)&quot; to the log, which you can then use to compare timings when optimizing your code.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You may give an optional logger level as the second argument (:debug, :info, :warn, :error); the default value is :info.
