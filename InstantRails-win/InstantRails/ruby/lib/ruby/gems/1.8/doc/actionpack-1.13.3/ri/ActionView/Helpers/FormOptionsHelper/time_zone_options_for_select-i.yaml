- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns a string of option tags for pretty much any time zone in the world. Supply a TimeZone name as <tt>selected</tt> to have it marked as the selected option tag. You can also supply an array of TimeZone objects as <tt>priority_zones</tt>, so that they will be listed above the rest of the (long) list. (You can use TimeZone.us_zones as a convenience for obtaining a list of the US time zones.)
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The <tt>selected</tt> parameter must be either <tt>nil</tt>, or a string that names a TimeZone.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "By default, <tt>model</tt> is the TimeZone constant (which can be obtained in ActiveRecord as a value object). The only requirement is that the <tt>model</tt> parameter be an object that responds to #all, and returns an array of objects that represent time zones."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "NOTE: Only the option tags are returned, you have to wrap this call in a regular HTML select tag."
