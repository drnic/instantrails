    body: "Find by id: This can either be a specific id (1), a list of ids (1, 5, 6), or an array of ids ([5, 6, 10]). If no record can be found for all of the listed ids, then RecordNotFound will be raised."

    body: "Find first: This will return the first record matched by the options used. These options can either be specific conditions or merely an order. If no record can matched, nil is returned."

    body: "Find all: This will return all the records matched by the options used. If no records are found, an empty array is returned."

    body: "<tt>:conditions</tt>: An SQL fragment like &quot;administrator = 1&quot; or [ &quot;user_name = ?&quot;, username ]. See conditions in the intro."

    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:offset</tt>: An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So at 5, it would skip the first 4 rows."

    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:joins</tt>: An SQL fragment for additional joins like &quot;LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id&quot;. (Rarely needed). The records will be returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond to the table's columns. Pass :readonly =&gt; false to override."

    body: "<tt>:include</tt>: Names associations that should be loaded alongside using LEFT OUTER JOINs. The symbols named refer to already defined associations. See eager loading under Associations."

    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:select</tt>: By default, this is * as in SELECT * FROM, but can be changed if you for example want to do a join, but not include the joined columns."

    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>:readonly</tt>: Mark the returned records read-only so they cannot be saved or updated."
