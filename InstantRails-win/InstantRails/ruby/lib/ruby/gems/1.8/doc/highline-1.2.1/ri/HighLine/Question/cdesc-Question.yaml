    body: Can be set to <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> to control whether or not input will be echoed back to the user. A setting of <tt>true</tt> will cause echo to match input, but any other true value will be treated as to String to echo for each character typed.

    body: When set to a non <b>nil</b> value, this will be tried as an answer to the question. If this answer passes validations, it will become the result without the user ever being prompted. Otherwise this value is discarded, and this Question is resolved as a normal call to HighLine.ask().

    body: When set, the user will be prompted for multiple answers which will be collected into an Array or Hash and returned as the final answer.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: You can set <em>gather</em> to an Integer to have an Array of exactly that many answers collected, or a String/Regexp to match an end input which will not be returned in the Array.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Optionally <em>gather</em> can be set to a Hash. In this case, the question will be asked once for each key and the answers will be returned in a Hash, mapped by key. The <tt>@key</tt> variable is set before each question is evaluated, so you can use it in your question.
