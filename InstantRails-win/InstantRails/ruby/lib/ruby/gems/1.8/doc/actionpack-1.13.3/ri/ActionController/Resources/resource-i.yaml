  body: "See map.resources for general conventions. These are the main differences:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  - a singular name is given to map.resource.  The default controller name is taken from the singular name.\n  - To specify a custom plural name, use the :plural option.  There is no :singular option\n  - No default index, new, or create routes are created for the singleton resource controller.\n  - When nesting singleton resources, only the singular name is used as the path prefix (example: 'account/messages/1')\n"
