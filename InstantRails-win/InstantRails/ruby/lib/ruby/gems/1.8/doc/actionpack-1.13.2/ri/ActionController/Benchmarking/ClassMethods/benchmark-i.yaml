- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Log and benchmark the workings of a single block and silence whatever logging that may have happened inside it (unless <tt>use_silence</tt> is set to false).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The benchmark is only recorded if the current level of the logger matches the <tt>log_level</tt>, which makes it easy to include benchmarking statements in production software that will remain inexpensive because the benchmark will only be conducted if the log level is low enough.
