      <h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
   A series of extra constants for the Dir class that define special folders
   on Win32 systems, , as well as methods for creating and detecting junctions
   (i.e. symlinks for directories).
</pre>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Manual</h2>
<pre>
   ruby test\tc_dir.rb (optional)
   ruby install.rb
</pre>
<h2>Gems</h2>
<pre>
   ruby win32-dir.gemspec
   gem install win32-dir-X.Y.Z-mswin32.gem
</pre>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<pre>
   Some tests may fail.  That is expected, because not all constants are
   necessarily defined on your system.
</pre>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<pre>
   require &quot;win32/dir&quot;

   # C:\WINNT or C:\WINDOWS
   puts Dir::WINDOWS

   # C:\Documents and Settings\Daniel\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools
   puts Dir::ADMINTOOLS

   Dir.mkdir('C:\from')
   Dir.create_junction('C:\to', 'C:\from')
</pre>

<h2>Developer&#8216;s Notes</h2>
<pre>
   The SHGetFolderPath() documentation on MSDN is somewhat vague about which
   CSIDL constants are guaranteed to be defined.  However, there are 15 which
   *should* be defined (see docs above).  The rest I cannot vouch for.  On
   my own Windows XP SP 2 system, all but 7 were defined.
</pre>
<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<pre>
   The Unicode support is not quite there for Dir.create_junction.  It creates
   the directory and junction fine, but the +to+ name appears to get garbled
   with regards to the character set.

   Please log any other bug reports on the RubyForge project page at
   http://www.rubyforge.net/projects/win32utils.
</pre>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<pre>
   Fix the Unicode issue with Dir.create_junction.
   Other suggestions welcome.
</pre>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<pre>
   Shashank Date and Zach Dennis for the suggestion and supporting comments
   on the mailing list.

   Timothy Byrd and Autrijus Tang for help (directly or indirectly) with the
   junction methods.  Timothy provided a pure Ruby version of the junction
   code that I later borrowed from.

   Most of the documentation was copied from the MSDN web site.
