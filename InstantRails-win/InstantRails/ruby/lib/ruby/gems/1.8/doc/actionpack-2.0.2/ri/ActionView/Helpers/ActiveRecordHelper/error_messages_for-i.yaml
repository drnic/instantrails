    label: "*"
    body: "<tt>header_message</tt> - The message in the header of the error div. Pass <tt>nil</tt> or an empty string to avoid the header message altogether. (default: X errors prohibited this object from being saved)"

- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "NOTE: This is a pre-packaged presentation of the errors with embedded strings and a certain HTML structure. If what you need is significantly different from the default presentation, it makes plenty of sense to access the object.errors instance yourself and set it up. View the source of this method to see how easy it is."
