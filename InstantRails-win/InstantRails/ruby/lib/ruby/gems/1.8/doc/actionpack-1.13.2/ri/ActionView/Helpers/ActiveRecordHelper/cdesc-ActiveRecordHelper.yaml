  body: The Active Record Helper makes it easier to create forms for records kept in instance variables. The most far-reaching is the form method that creates a complete form for all the basic content types of the record (not associations or aggregations, though). This is a great of making the record quickly available for editing, but likely to prove lackluster for a complicated real-world form. In that case, it's better to use the input method and the specialized form methods in link:classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html
