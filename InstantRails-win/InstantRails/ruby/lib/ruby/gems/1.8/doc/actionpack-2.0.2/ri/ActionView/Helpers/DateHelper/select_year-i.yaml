  body: Returns a select tag with options for each of the five years on each side of the current, which is selected. The five year radius can be changed using the <tt>:start_year</tt> and <tt>:end_year</tt> keys in the <tt>options</tt>. Both ascending and descending year lists are supported by making <tt>:start_year</tt> less than or greater than <tt>:end_year</tt>. The <tt>date</tt> can also be substituted for a year given as a number. Override the field name using the <tt>:field_name</tt> option, 'year' by default.
