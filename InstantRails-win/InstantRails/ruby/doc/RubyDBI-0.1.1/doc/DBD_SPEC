== DBD Directory Layout
The directory layout is the following:

  DBD/
  DBD/Driver1
  DBD/Driver1/Driver1.rb
  DBD/Driver1/helper.rb
  .
  .

  DBD/Driver2
  .
  .
  .

Where "Driver1" and "Driver2" are DBD driver names.
For example, if you have two drivers installed named "Oracle" and 
"Sybase", the layout would look like:

  DBD/
  DBD/Oracle
  DBD/Oracle/Oracle.rb         # <== this is the main driver
  DBD/Oracle/oracle.so         # <== is used by Oracle.rb

  DBD/Sybase/Sybase.so         # <== this is the main driver
                               # has no helper files

When DBI loads a DBD driver, it searches all "DBD" directories in Ruby's
LOAD_PATH ($:).

Database dependent functions, that should be callable with (({DBI::func})), must
use the prefix "__" before their method names, to prevent nameclashes with 
further versions of Ruby/DBI!

== Driver Name
The DBD driver is simply named after the Database, e.g., Oracle, DB2, etc.
The suffix normally will be ".rb" but can be any other valid suffix that is
possible for Ruby to load, e.g., ".so", ".sl" or ".dll", and depends
for non-Ruby DBD driver on the underlying operating system.
When I refer to the driver name, then I speak of the filename without
the suffix, e.g., Oracle or DB2.

The name specified in the DSN ((-Data Source Name, e.g., "dbi:Oracle:oracle.neumann"-)) 
must be the same as the driver name. 

== Classes provided by a DBD
A DBD driver has to provide three classes in the namespace
(({DBI::DBD::}))((*DriverName*)), where ((*DriverName*)) is the name of the 
driver, e.g., Oracle or DB2.

The three classes must be named (({Driver})), (({Database})) and (({Statement})).

== Class Driver
This class must inherit from (({DBI::BaseDriver})).

=== Methods that must be provided by (({Driver}))

--- connect( dbname, user, auth, attr )
    Connects to a database and returns a newly created (({Database})) object.

=== Optional methods that can be specified by (({Driver}))

--- default_user
    Returns an array of the form (({['username', 'password']})) which represents
    the default user when no username and password were specified.

    Defaults to (({['', '']})) if not implemented.

--- default_attributes
    Returns a (({Hash})) containing the default attributes that are used
    in ((<connect>)) in addition to the ones the user specifies.
  
    Defaults to (({{}})) (empty hash) if not implemented.   
 
--- data_sources
    Returns an array of all valid DSNs this driver can access.
    
    Defaults to (({[]})) (empty array) if not implemented.     


--- disconnect_all
    Disconnects all connections made with this driver.

    If this method is not implemented,
    the default is to raise a NotImplementedError exception.


== Class Database
This class must inherit from (({DBI::BaseDatabase})).

=== Methods that must be provided by (({Database}))

--- disconnect
    Disconnects from the database.
    But you must first roll back all outstanding transactions, so 
    all changes not yet committed get lost (are discarded).

--- prepare( statement )
    Prepares the SQL ((|statement|)) and returns an object of class (({Statement})).

--- ping
    Pings the database to check whether the connection is alive.
    This can be implemented by executing a SQL statement like
    "SELECT 1 FROM DUAL" for Oracle database.
    For other databases,
    this should be a query on a table that normally always exists.

    Returns (({true})) if the connection is alive, otherwise (({false})).

=== Optional methods that can be specified by (({Database}))

--- commit
--- rollback
    Commits or rolls back the current transaction.
 
    The default is to raise a NotSupportedError exception, so if the database does not implement 
    transactions (mSQL, CSV), do not overwrite this method.

--- tables
    Returns an (({Array})) of all tables and views. 
    
    The default is to return the empty (({Array})) ((({[]}))).

--- columns( table )
    Returns more information about the columns of the table ((|table|)). 
    Returns an (({Array})) of (({Hash})) objects, like (({Statement#column_info})) does.

    The default is to return an empty (({Array})) ((({[]}))).
 
--- execute( statement, *bindvars )
    Immediate execution (without preparation) of SQL ((|statement|))
    after binding the values in ((|bindvars|)) to the placeholders in the statement.

    Returns a (({Statement})) object.
 
    Defaults to the call sequence of (({Database#prepare()})), (({Statement#bind_params()})) and 
    (({Statement#execute()})).

--- do( statement, *bindvars )
    Execution of SQL ((|statement|)), after binding the values given
    in ((|bindvars|)) to the placeholders in the statement, but without returning a (({Statement})) object.
    So this is used for 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE' as well as for DCL, which
    do not return a result set.

    Returns the RPC (Row Processed Count) or (({nil})) if no RPC is available.

    Defaults to (({Database#execute()})) and (({Statement#rows()})) followed by (({Statement#finish()})). 

--- quote( value )
    Quotes the given value ((|value|)) in database-specific fashion and returns the result.

    NOTE: This method is not really useful, because of (({Statement#bind_param})). 

--- []( attr )
    Returns the value of the attribute ((|attr|)).

    The default is to return the value of (({@attr[attr]})).

--- []=( attr, value ) 
    Sets the value of the attribute ((|attr|)) to ((|value|)).
    An attribute is, e.g., "AutoCommit".
    Raises a NotSupportedError exception if the database does not support an attribute.

    The default implementation is to raise a NotSupportedError exception.

   

== Class Statement
This class must inherit from (({DBI::BaseStatement})).

=== Methods that must be provided by (({Statement}))

--- bind_param( param, value, attribs )
    Binds the value ((|value|)) to a placeholder.
    The placeholder is represented by ((|param|)), which is either a
    (({String})) representing the name of the 
    placeholder used in the SQL statement (e.g., Oracle: "SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = :ename") 
    or a (({Fixnum})) that indicates the number of the placeholder.
    Placeholder numbers begin at 1.

    If ((|value|)) is a (({String})), then the default SQL type is (({VARCHAR})) or (({CHAR})).
    If ((|value|)) is a (({Fixnum})) or (({Bignum})), the default SQL type is (({INT})).
    If ((|value|)) is a (({Float})), the default SQL type is (({FLOAT})).

    ((|attribs|)) is not yet used in this version but could be a hash containing more information
    like parameter type, etc.

--- execute
    Execute the statement.

--- finish
    Free all the resources for the statement.
    After calling ((<finish>)), no other operation on this
    statement is valid.

--- fetch
    Fetches the current row.
    Returns an (({Array})) containing all column data or (({nil})) if
    the last column has been read.

    Note: This method should not return a newly created object on each call; 
    instead, you should return one and the same (({Array})) object but with 
    changed data. 


--- column_info
    Returns an (({Array})) of (({Hash})) objects, one for each column.
    Each (({Hash})) object must have at least one key 'name' which 
    value is the name of that column.
    Further possible values are 'sql_type' (integer, e.g., DBI::SQL_INT), 
    'type_name' (string), 'precision' (= column size), 'scale' (= decimal digits),
    'default', 'nullable', 'indexed', 'primary' and 'unique'.

--- rows
    Returns the RPC (Row Processed Count) of the last executed statement, or
    (({nil})) if no such exists.


=== Optional methods that can be specified by (({Statement}))

--- bind_params( *bindvars )
    Binds the values in ((|bindvars|)) to the placeholders in the statement.

    Defaults to calling ((<bind_param>)) for each value, with ((|param|)) starting
    from 1 increasingly.

--- cancel 
    Free any result set resources which were made after a call to ((<execute>)).
    After calling this method, calls to any of the ((*fetch*)) methods are no longer valid.

    The default is to do nothing.

--- fetch_scroll( direction, offset )
    ((|direction|)) is one of the following constants:
    * SQL_FETCH_NEXT
    * SQL_FETCH_PRIOR
    * SQL_FETCH_FIRST
    * SQL_FETCH_LAST
    * SQL_FETCH_ABSOLUTE
    * SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE
    
    ((|offset|)) is a positive or negative number (only when SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE is used).

    By default, only SQL_FETCH_NEXT, SQL_FETCH_LAST, SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE (if positive) are
    implemented. Otherwise, this method raises a NotSupportedError exception.

    Note: This method should not return a newly created object on each call; 
    instead, you should return one and the same (({Array})) object but with 
    changed data. 


--- fetch_many( cnt )
    Returns an (({Array})) of the next ((|cnt|)) rows, where a row is itself an (({Array})).

    Note: Unlike ((<fetch>)), this method should return a new (({Array})) object.
 
    If ((|cnt|)) rows are not available, return the rest (as many as are available).
    Returns (({nil})) if no rows are available.

    Defaults to multiple calls to ((<fetch>)).

--- fetch_all
    Returns an (({Array})) of all rows that have not yet been fetched, where a row is 
    itself an (({Array})) (see (({Statement#fetch_many}))).

    Note: Unlike ((<fetch>)), this method should return a new (({Array})) object.

    Returns (({nil})) if no rows are available.

    Defaults to multiple calls to ((<fetch>)).

--- []( attr )
    Returns the value of the attribute ((|attr|)).

    The default is to return the value of (({@attr[attr]})).

--- []=( attr, value ) 
    Set the value of the attribute ((|attr|)) to ((|value|)).
    Raise a NotSupportedError exception if the database does not support an attribute.

    The default implementation is to raise a NotSupportedError exception.
