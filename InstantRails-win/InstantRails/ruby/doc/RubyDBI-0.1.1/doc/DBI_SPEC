=== Exceptions

Exception classes were "borrowed" from Python API 2.0.

--- Warning < RuntimeError
    For important warnings such as data truncation, etc.

--- Error < RuntimeError
    Base class of all other error exceptions.
    Use this to catch all errors.

--- InterfaceError < Error
    Exception for errors related to the DBI interface rather 
    than the database itself.

--- NotImplementedError < InterfaceError
    Exception raised if the DBD driver has not specified
    a mandatory method (not in Python API 2.0).

--- DatabaseError < Error
    Exception for errors related to the database.
 
    Has three attributes: ((|err|)), ((|errstr|)) and ((|state|)).

--- DataError < DatabaseError
    Exception for errors due to problems with the processed 
    data, such ase division by zero, numeric value out of range, etc.

--- OperationalError < DatabaseError
    Exception for errors related to the database's operation which
    are not necessarily under the control of the programmer, such as
    unexpected disconnect, datasource name not found, transaction
    could not be processed, a memory allocation error occurred during
    processing, etc.

--- IntegrityError < DatabaseError
    Exception raised when the relational integrity of the database
    is affected, e.g., a foreign key check fails.

--- InternalError < DatabaseError
    Exception raised when the database encounters an internal error, 
    e.g., the cursor is not valid anymore, the transaction is out of sync.

--- ProgrammingError < DatabaseError
    Exception raised for programming errors, e.g., table not found
    or already exists, syntax error in SQL statement, wrong number
    of parameters specified, etc.

--- NotSupportedError < DatabaseError
    Raised if, e.g., ((<commit>)) is called for a database that does not
    support transactions.


=== Module functions

--- DBI.connect( driver_url, user=nil, auth=nil, params=nil )
    Connect to the database specified by ((|driver_url|)), which may
    look like "dbi:Oracle:oracle.neumann".
 
    Returns a (({DBI::DatabaseHandle})) object, or if called with a code-block,
    calls this block with the new (({DBI::DatabaseHandle})) as parameter and
    calls ((<disconnect>)) after calling the block if it was not yet disconnected by
    the user.

--- DBI.available_drivers
    Returns an (({Array})) of all available DBD drivers.
    The strings which represent the DBD drivers are partial DSNs
    (e.g., "dbi:Oracle:").

--- DBI.data_sources( driver )
    Returns all available DSNs for the ((|driver|)), which
    is a partial DSN (e.g., "dbi:Oracle:").

--- DBI.disconnect_all( driver=nil )
    Disconnects all active connections of ((|driver|)) or
    all drivers if ((|driver|)) is (({nil})).

--- DBI.trace(mode=nil, output=nil)
    Sets the trace mode for all subsequently created Handles to these values.

    If a parameter is (({nil})), the value is not changed.
    ((|mode|)) defaults to 2 if it is (({nil})), and ((|output|)) to (({STDERR})) if a value was not
    previously set.
    For ((|mode|)), the values 0, 1, 2 or 3 are allowed.

    Note: Tracing is only activated if you load the module "dbi/trace", because tracing currently
    depends on AspectR > 0.3.3.

== Class DBI::Handle

Abstract base class for all "Handles" (DriverHandle, DatabaseHandle, StatementHandle).

=== Instance Methods

--- func( function, *values )
    Calls the driver-specific extension function named by
    ((|function|)) with ((|values|)) as parameters.

--- trace(mode=nil, output=nil)
    Sets the trace mode for this handle as well as for all sub-handles (in the case of DriverHandle and 
    DatabaseHandle).

    If a parameter is (({nil})), the value is not changed.
    ((|mode|)) defaults to 2 if it is (({nil})), and ((|output|)) to (({STDERR})) if a value was not
    previously set.
    For ((|mode|)), the values 0, 1, 2 or 3 are allowed.

    Note: Tracing is only activated if you load the module "dbi/trace", because tracing currently
    depends on AspectR > 0.3.3.


== Class DBI::DatabaseHandle

=== Superclass

--- DBI::Handle


=== Instance Methods

--- connected?
    Returns (({true})) if the connection was not yet disconnected
    by calling ((<disconnect>)), otherwise (({false})).

--- disconnect
    Disconnects the connection.

--- prepare( stmt )
--- prepare( stmt ) {|statement_handle| aBlock}
    Prepares the SQL statement ((|stmt|)) and returns a
    (({DBI::StatementHandle})), or if called with a code-block,
    calls the block with the handle as its parameter and after that
    calls (({#finish})) onto the handle to free all resources

--- execute( stmt, *bindvars )
--- execute( stmt, *bindvars ) {|statement_handle| aBlock}
    Immediately executes the SQL statement ((|stmt|)) after binding
    the values in ((|bindvars|)) to the placeholders in the statement.

    Returns a (({DBI::StatementHandle})), or if called with a code-block,
    calls the block with the handle as its parameter and after that
    calls (({#finish})) onto the handle to free all resources.

--- do( stmt, *bindvars )
    Same as ((<execute>)) except the RPC (Row Processed Count) is returned
    rather than a (({DBI::StatementHandle})).
   
--- select_one( stmt, *bindvars)
    Executes the statement after binding the values to the placeholders in the statement, then returns the
    first row as a reference to a (({DBI::Row})) object. 

--- select_all( stmt, *bindvars)
    Executes the statement after binding the values to the parameters, then returns all
    resulting rows as an array of (({DBI::Row})) objects. 

    If called as an iterator, the passed (({DBI::Row})) objects are only references.
 
--- tables
    Returns a list of all tables and views.

--- columns( table )
    Gets more information about the columns of the table ((|table|)). 
    Returns an array containing a (({DBI::ColumnInfo})) object for each column
    in the table.

--- ping
    Returns (({true})) if the connection is active, otherwise (({false})).
    
    In contrast to ((<connected?>)), ((<ping>)) tests if the connection is
    still active by executing some SQL or doing something else.
    
--- quote( value )
    Quotes the given value ((|value|)) in database-specific fashion and returns the result.

--- commit
    Commits the current transaction.

--- rollback
    Rolls back the current transaction.

--- transaction {|database_handle| aBlock}
    First commits the current transaction, then
    executes the given block where the parameter is
    the object itself (the database handle). If the
    block raises an exception, then it rolls back the transaction;
    otherwise, it commits the transaction.

--- [](attr)
--- []=(attr)
    Gets or sets the attribute ((|attr|)).
    An attribute can for example be "AutoCommit", which can be set to 
    (({true})) or (({false})). Attributes are database dependent.

== Class DBI::StatementHandle

=== Superclass

--- DBI::Handle

=== Mixins

--- Enumerable

=== Instance Methods

--- bind_param( param, value, attribs=nil )
    Binds the value ((|value|)) to a placeholder.
    The placeholder is represented by ((|param|)), which is either a
    (({String})) representing the name of the 
    placeholder used in the SQL statement (e.g., Oracle: "SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = :ename"),
    or an integer that indicates the number of the placeholder.
    Placeholder numbers begin at 1.

    ((|attribs|)) is not yet used in this version, but could later be a hash containing more information
    like parameter type, etc.


--- execute( *bindvars )
    Executes the statement after binding the values in ((|bindvars|)) to the placeholders in the statement.

--- finish
    Frees the resources for the statement.
    After calling ((<finish>)), no other operation on this
    statement is valid.

--- cancel
    Frees any result set resources which were made after a call 
    to ((<execute>)).
    After calling this method, calls to any of the ((*fetch*)) methods 
    are no longer valid.

--- column_names
    Returns an (({Array})) of all column names.


--- column_info
    Returns an (({Array})) containing a (({DBI::ColumnInfo})) object for each column
    in the result set.

--- rows
    Returns the RPC (Row Processed Count) of the last executed statement, or
    (({nil})) if no such exists.


--- fetchable?
    Returns (({true})) if you can fetch rows using ((<fetch>)), etc.
 

--- fetch 
    Returns a (({DBI::Row})) object, or (({nil})) if there are
    no more rows to fetch.

    When called as an iterator, the block is called for each row
    until no more rows are available. Each row is passed to the
    block as a (({DBI::Row})) object.

    Note that the returned or passed (({DBI::Row})) object is only a reference and
    should be copied (dup) if it is stored elsewhere.


--- each  {|row| aBlock }
    Same as ((<fetch>)) called as an iterator.


--- fetch_array
    Returns the current row as an (({Array})) or (({nil})) if no more
    rows are available.

    Can also be called as an iterator.

--- fetch_hash 
    Returns the current row as a (({Hash})) or (({nil})) if no more
    rows are available.
    
    Can also be called as an iterator.

--- fetch_many( cnt )
    Returns an (({Array})) of the next ((|cnt|)) rows, which are
    stored as (({DBI::Row})) objects. 

    Returns the empty array (({[]})) if there are no more rows.

--- fetch_all
    Same as ((<fetch_many>)) except that all rows are returned.
 
--- fetch_scroll( direction, offset=1 )
    ((|direction|)) is one of the following constants:
    * SQL_FETCH_NEXT
    * SQL_FETCH_PRIOR
    * SQL_FETCH_FIRST
    * SQL_FETCH_LAST
    * SQL_FETCH_ABSOLUTE
    * SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE
    
    ((|offset|)) is a positive or negative number (only when SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE is used).

    ((<fetch_scroll>)) does not automatically free the result set if no more rows are available,
    e.g., if you get the last row. 
    
    Returns a (({DBI::Row})) object, or (({nil})) if no row is available.

    Note that the returned (({DBI::Row})) object is only a reference and
    should be copied (dup) if it is stored elsewhere.

--- [](attr)
--- []=(attr)
    Gets or sets the attribute ((|attr|)).
