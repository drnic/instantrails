1. This version was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6, not Cygwin.
As a result, some I/O functionality -- particularly those involving
the Unix fork() system call and pipes -- will not work. The benefit
of using MSVC is to have a more stable and reliable version of Ruby.

2. Previous versions of the One-Click Installer contained an (old)
version of Tcl/Tk. Now this installer only contains the Ruby bindings
to whatever version of Tcl/Tk you wish to install. We recommend
ActiveTcl: http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/
