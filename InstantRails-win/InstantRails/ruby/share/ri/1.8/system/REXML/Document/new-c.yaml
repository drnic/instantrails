  body: Constructor @param source if supplied, must be a Document, String, or IO. Documents have their context and Element attributes cloned. Strings are expected to be valid XML documents. IOs are expected to be sources of valid XML documents. @param context if supplied, contains the context of the document; this should be a Hash. NOTE that I'm not sure what the context is for; I cloned it out of the Electric XML API (in which it also seems to do nothing), and it is now legacy. It may do something, someday... it may disappear.
